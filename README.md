# 🎮 Mobile Game Competitor Analysis Project 

---

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes three mobile free-to-play games in the idle/strategy genre.  
The goal was to study **core gameplay loops**, **retention mechanics**, and **monetization models**, and then propose improvements that could increase **player engagement** and **long-term retention**.

## 📊 Games Analyzed
1. **Idle Miner Tycoon** (Kolibri Games)  
2. **Adventure Capitalist** (Hyper Hippo Games)  
3. **March of Empires** (Gameloft)

## 🔄 Core Gameplay Loops

| Game                  | Core Loop                                      | Retention Mechanics                          | Monetization                                  |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Idle Miner Tycoon** | Upgrade mines → hire managers → collect income | Daily rewards, prestige reset system, events | Ads for boosts, IAP for premium currency       |
| **Adventure Capitalist** | Tap/click to earn → invest → unlock planets  | Daily logins, reset with “angels” multipliers | Heavy ad-based, bundles & premium packs       |
| **March of Empires**  | Build empire → train armies → expand territories | Alliances, daily login rewards, events      | IAP packs, speed-ups, VIP memberships         |

## ✅ Strengths Across Games
- Short play sessions → easy to jump in.  
- Progression systems (prestige, resets, upgrades) keep players hooked.  
- Daily rewards encourage consistent logins.  
- Community features (alliances in March of Empires) boost retention.  

---

## ⚠️ Weaknesses Identified
- Rewards often become repetitive after a few weeks.  
- Ads are intrusive in Idle Miner and Adventure Capitalist, reducing satisfaction.  
- Some progression (March of Empires) feels too pay-to-win, frustrating free players.  

---

## 💡 Suggested Improvements
1. **Progressive Reward Tiers** – escalating daily rewards (e.g., Day 7 → rare item/skin).  
2. **Seasonal Events & Cosmetics** – Halloween, Summer, etc. with exclusive rewards.  
3. **Balanced Monetization** – reduce ad frequency, add more rewarding boosts and cosmetics.  
4. **Social Enhancements** – expand alliances and co-op play to include free-to-play players.  

---

## 📑 Summary
This analysis shows how popular idle/strategy games attract and retain players, while also highlighting areas for improvement.  
My recommendations focus on:  
- Improving **player motivation** through varied rewards and events.  
- Creating a more **balanced monetization system**.  
- Strengthening **community engagement** with better social features.

## 🚀 Next Steps
Future iterations of this project may include:  
- Building a **small Excel dashboard** to track KPIs (retention, ARPDAU).  
- Expanding the analysis to **5–10 games** for deeper benchmarking.  
- Creating a **mini GDD (Game Design Document)** based on the suggested improvements.
